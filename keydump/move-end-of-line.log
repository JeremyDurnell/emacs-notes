<end> (translated from <S-end>) runs the command move-end-of-line
(found in global-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function
in ‘simple.el’.

It is bound to <end>.

(move-end-of-line ARG)

Move point to end of current line as displayed.
With argument ARG not nil or 1, move forward ARG - 1 lines first.
If point reaches the beginning or end of buffer, it stops there.

To ignore the effects of the ‘intangible’ text or overlay
property, bind ‘inhibit-point-motion-hooks’ to t.
If there is an image in the current line, this function
disregards newlines that are part of the text on which the image
rests.

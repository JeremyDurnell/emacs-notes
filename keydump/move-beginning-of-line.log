<home> (translated from <S-home>) runs the command
move-beginning-of-line (found in global-map), which is an interactive
compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’.

It is bound to C-a, <home>.

(move-beginning-of-line ARG)

Move point to beginning of current line as displayed.
(If there’s an image in the line, this disregards newlines
which are part of the text that the image rests on.)

With argument ARG not nil or 1, move forward ARG - 1 lines first.
If point reaches the beginning or end of buffer, it stops there.
(But if the buffer doesn’t end in a newline, it stops at the
beginning of the last line.)
To ignore intangibility, bind ‘inhibit-point-motion-hooks’ to t.

<C-end> (translated from <C-S-end>) runs the command end-of-buffer
(found in global-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function
in ‘simple.el’.

It is bound to <C-end>, M->, <menu-bar> <edit> <goto> <end-of-buf>.

(end-of-buffer &optional ARG)

This function is for interactive use only;
in Lisp code use `(goto-char (point-max))' instead.

Move point to the end of the buffer.
With numeric arg N, put point N/10 of the way from the end.
If the buffer is narrowed, this command uses the end of the
accessible part of the buffer.

Push mark at previous position, unless either a C-u prefix
is supplied, or Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active.

<C-home> (translated from <C-S-home>) runs the command
beginning-of-buffer (found in global-map), which is an interactive
compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’.

It is bound to <begin>, <C-home>, M-<, <menu-bar> <edit> <goto>
<beg-of-buf>.

(beginning-of-buffer &optional ARG)

This function is for interactive use only;
in Lisp code use `(goto-char (point-min))' instead.

Move point to the beginning of the buffer.
With numeric arg N, put point N/10 of the way from the beginning.
If the buffer is narrowed, this command uses the beginning of the
accessible part of the buffer.

Push mark at previous position, unless either a C-u prefix
is supplied, or Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active.
